## XP Core Values

- Communication

I think our team is full of dedicated professionals, who reach out to each otherregarding technical issues and process flow, over a phone call thus resolving them quickly and move forward

- Simplicity

- Respect

All team members do not interfere in the work of other team members and do not boss over them checking for status. Individuals take responsibility
