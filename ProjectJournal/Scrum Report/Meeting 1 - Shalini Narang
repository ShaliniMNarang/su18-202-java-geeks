## XP Core Values

- Communication
Communication is the key to success for any project. We are connected on WhatsApp and use it as our messaging app. Apart from this we connected using zoom meetings after every 2 days to discuss the design and health of the project.

- Simplicity

- Feedback
As team we are open to give and accept feedback. We all are designing each domain as a micro service and we exchanged review comments for the RAML published by each one of us.

- Courage
We as a team are taking the unconventional way of programming by implementing each domain as a micro service. We are ready to accept any unforeseen challenge .

- Respect
