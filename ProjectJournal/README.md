## Individual Contributions

### Sunder Thyagarajan

As part of the team project I was responsible for building users microservices, and deploy the same in cloud a container namely GKE. I wore the hat of product owner and scrum master and built Task dashboard in GIT, followed by formatting the Burndown chart. As a architect designed the REST API using RAML and built a mock service using getsandbox.com, to remove blockers for all dependent stake holders. I took the appraoch domain driven design and used aggregations over a traditional database approach.
